/* 
I learned a lot of stuff in this assignment. I have no former experience with c++ so it was intresting
to try out and program. Some stuff is of course pretty similier to python so of course i understood 
some stuff easily. But i would say that there are also alot of diffrences and some of the tasks were 
pretty hard so solve and complete. I had to google alot to get help cause i didn't understand how
you should solve some of the tasks, for exampel task 5 i belive with printf_s and scanf, were it also
only worked with scanf for me for some reason. I also talked with my friends and got great information
from them how to solve the excersices. For only having 3 lessons i would say they were kinda hard but
it was possible solving them and they were fairly easy to understand.
